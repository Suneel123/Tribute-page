                <li>Rao developed research interest in mathematics, when he was a student of the B A (Hons)
                    degree course at the age of 17 in Andhra University.
                </li>
                <li>He obtained the B A (Hons) degree in mathematics at the age of 19, with a first class and

                    Calcutta for training in statistics at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). This chance 
                    encounter led Rao to join the training programme in statistics at ISI hoping that with
                    some additional qualifition he could get some job.
                </li>
                <li>Rao joined in ISI in 1941 at the age of 20 and started doing research by himself and pulishing
                    papers. He received M A degree in statistics from Calcutta University in 1943 with a 
                    first class, first rank and a highest percentage of marks which remains unbroken upto now.

                <li>A request from the Department of Anthropology, Cambridge University was sent to ISI in 1946

                    D-square statistic. Rao was sent to Cambridge by Mahalanobis and he worked in Cambridge for two 
                    years (1946 - 1948) as a visiting scholar at Cambridge University Museun of Archaeology and 
                    Anthropology.
